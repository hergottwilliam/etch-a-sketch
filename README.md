# etch-a-sketch
This webpage allows the user to create pixel art, similiar to that made by an etch-a-sketch toy, with some extra features! Hovering your mouse over the sketchpad will color pixels black, and just like a real etch-a-sketch, you must create art with "connected" lines. I have added several buttons and a range slider that allow the user to change the color of their drawing, erase, clear the sketchpad, and change the dimensions of the sketchpad.
